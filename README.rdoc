The name of this project is Social Deck.  The idea is to have a single site that can pull together all of your activity on other social sites into one place.  
It also has its own system of posts/comments (where Facebook posts are currently being pulled into as well).
Twitter posts are pulled in and styled using the Twitter oEmbed API.
The posts are arranged on the screen using masonry.js, and there are AJAX elements for leaving comments and selecting a photo for picture posts.
TODO:
--Facebook posts and comments currently import as regular posts, want to have them embedded like the Twitter posts
  --have tried noembed and embed.ly as well but haven't found anything suitable yet
--Add more networks
--Improve the styling/formatting
